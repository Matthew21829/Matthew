## buñuelo first session 1 - [2 hours]
What i did: I downloaded the programs and then configured everything as shown in the tutorial. I wanted to create a schematic for four buttons and four LEDs.
Once the program was open, I imported the XIAO-RP2024 chip and placed it in my schematic. After that, I added the four buttons and then imported the LEDs, adding four of them and connecting a resistor to each
When that was ready, I connected them to the chip using the global tags and then connected them to ground. And that's how the schematic turned out.
