# buñuelo
## buñuelo first session 2 - [2 hours]
What i did: I downloaded the programs and then configured everything as shown in the tutorial. I wanted to create a schematic for four buttons and four LEDs.
Once the program was open, I imported the XIAO-RP2024 chip and placed it in my schematic. After that, I added the four buttons and then imported the LEDs, adding four of them and connecting a resistor to each
When that was ready, I connected them to the chip using the global tags and then connected them to ground. And that's how the schematic turned out.

# buñuelo second session - [1 hour]
What i did: In this second session, I imported the schematic into the PCB editor. Once I had the elements from my schematic, I started organizing and arranging them to my liking to begin connecting them.
After that, I checked for any errors and then viewed them in the 3D model. Following this, I imported the 3D models of the components (buttons, LEDs, and the chip) and arranged them until everything was correctly positioned. 
Finally, I put the name of my PCB, and that was it.
